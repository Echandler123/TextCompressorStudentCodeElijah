Another idea was shorting extremely common words phrase or groups of letter such has the. |
| Dec 5   | 10:00 - 11:00 |                                                      Try making compress method by translating each word into codes then using a dictionary of words to restore the data in the expand method. Though I do not know what the codes should be as they have to unique for each word. I tried finding each word then writing out the length of the word first and then adding up the integer values of the chars making up the word the adding that as a code. I do not think this will work though as it will be impossible to know the value of each char that makes up the word. |

Started the compress method using the LZW algorithm using the pseudocode give. |

I also change my algorithm to no use substring because it made a copy of the string making it too expensive. Instead I changed my while loop be based of the index compared to the length of the text then using that index in the tst insert method. Then at the end of the loop I increment the index by the prefix length. |
| Dec 12  | 10:30 - 11:00 | I add an if statement to my compress method as I need to check if there are still codes left to use and if the compress method has reached the end of the text or not. I started my expand method starting with my dictionary to hold the codes from the compress method. Then I add all of the single characters in the position of their ascii value. I left the 256 for the eof so the codes start at 257 and a began reading in the codes. I also got the current string from the first string corresponding to the first code while define the next one as an empty string. |

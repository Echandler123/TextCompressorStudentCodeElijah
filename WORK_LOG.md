Another idea was shorting extremely common words phrase or groups of letter such has the. |
| Dec 5   | 10:00 - 11:00 |     Try making compress method by translating each word into codes then using a dictionary of words to restore the data in the expand method. Though I do not know what the codes should be as they have to unique for each word. I tried finding each word then writing out the length of the word first and then adding up the integer values of the chars makingu p the word the adding that as a code. I do not think this will work though as it will be impossible to know the value of each char that makes up the word. |

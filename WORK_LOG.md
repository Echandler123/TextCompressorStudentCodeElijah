Another idea was shorting extremely common words phrase or groups of letter such has the. |
| Dec 5   | 10:00 - 11:00 | Try making compress method by translating each word into codes then using a dictionary of words to restore the data in the expand method. Though I do not know what the codes should be as they have to unique for each word. I tried finding each word then writing out the length of the word first and then adding up the integer values of the chars making up the word the adding that as a code. I do not think this will work though as it will be impossible to know the value of each char that makes up the word. |

Started the compress method using the LZW algorithm using the pseudocode give. |

I also change my algorithm to no use substring because it made a copy of the string making it too expensive. Instead I changed my while loop be based of the index compared to the length of the tes then using that index in the tst insert method. Then at the end of the loop I increment the index by the prefix length. |
